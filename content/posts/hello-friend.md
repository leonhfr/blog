This is the start of yet another developer blog. It's been a long time coming as I have always wanted to have a blog but I have been postponing it.

Powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with theme [Anubis](https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis).

This blog uses Github features extensively:
- Github Pages for hosting
- Github Actions for deployment
- Github issues for comments (via [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/))
