Now, we have nice shell scripts that self document. But if you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you have lots of them in your ~/bin or wherever you put them. One reason is that each script can do one thing and one thing only. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice if we could group different functionalities in the same file?\nSome CLIs already do that with subcommands. Think git add or go get. We\u0026rsquo;re going to check how to simply have subcommands with shell scripts.\nFirst, we put each functionality in its own function. Each function should be prefixed sub_. Of course, we have the documentation at the top and a help function to parse and print the documentation. Note that each function also has a comment.\n#!/bin/bash ### ### my-script — does several things well ### ### Usage: my-script [options] \u0026lt;subcommand\u0026gt; ### ### Options: ### -h,--help: Show this message. ### ### Subcommands: ### help: show this message sub_help() { sed -rn \u0026#39;s/^### ?//p\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; } ### foo: do some the foo thing sub_foo() { echo \u0026#34;Running the foo subcommand\u0026#34; } ### bar: do the bar thing, which is related but different to the foo thing sub_bar() { echo \u0026#34;Running the bar subcommand\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;We can use first argument with \u0026#39;$1\u0026#39;\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;The second argument is \u0026#39;$2\u0026#39;, and so on\u0026#34; } Then, at the end of the script, we put this piece of magic:\nSCRIPT_NAME=$(basename $0) SUBCOMMAND=$1 case $SUBCOMMAND in \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | \u0026#34;-h\u0026#34; | \u0026#34;--help\u0026#34;) sub_help ;; *) shift sub_${SUBCOMMAND} $@ if [ $? = 127 ]; then echo \u0026#34;Error: \u0026#39;$SUBCOMMAND\u0026#39; is not a known subcommand.\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 echo \u0026#34; Run \u0026#39;$SCRIPT_NAME --help\u0026#39; for a list of known subcommands.\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit 1 fi ;; esac What\u0026rsquo;s happening here? Some notes:\nwe store the name of the script with basename; we use a bash case statement; we check the first argument, the subcommand, if it\u0026rsquo;s one of -h, --help, or empty, we print the help and exit; otherwise (see the *) which is the default case), we: use the shift command to shift positional parameters to the left, so command name which was in $1 is placed at $0 instead, and so on for other arguments; we execute the subcommand function with the repositioned arguments $@; if the subcommand doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, we print an error message using the script name. Now the cool thing about this is that not only can we add as many subcommands as we like, but the help message also gets updated with the subcommand comments, so the script is still self documenting.\nPrinting the help:\n$ my-script --help my-script — does several things well Usage: my-script [options] \u0026lt;subcommand\u0026gt; Options: -h,--help: Show this message. Subcommands: help: show this message foo: do the foo thing bar: do the bar thing, which is related but different to the foo thing Running the bar subcommand:\n$ my-script bar hello world Running the bar subcommand We can use first argument with \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39; The second argument is \u0026#39;world\u0026#39;, and so on Command that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist:\n$ my-script hello Error: \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39; is not a known subcommand. Run \u0026#39;my-script --help\u0026#39; for a list of known subcommands.

How often have you written one, put it in the bin directory and forgotten all about it? How cool would it be to have a help message for them?\nWe could, of course, implement it with a bunch of echo calls. But there\u0026rsquo;s a neat trick. I originally learned this trick in a blog post by Egor Kovetskiy, but the post seems to be gone. As it was very useful to me, I\u0026rsquo;m putting it out there again.\nAdd your help message as comments at the top of your file, right after the shebang.\n#!/bin/bash ### ### my-script — does one thing well ### ### Usage: ### my-script \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; \u0026lt;output\u0026gt; ### ### Options: ### \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; Input file to read. ### \u0026lt;output\u0026gt; Output file to write. Use \u0026#39;-\u0026#39; for stdout. ### -h Show this message. Next, we need to get this message using sed.\nsed -rn \u0026#39;s/^### ?//p\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; What\u0026rsquo;s happening here:\n$0 is the filename of the file that is being executed; -r flag means using extended regular expressions; -n flag prevents sed from echoing each line to the standard output; s stands for substitution of the following pattern; / defines the start and end of the pattern; ^### ? matches a string starting with ### followed by an optional space; // defines the substitution string, here an empty string; p prints the result of the substitution. Now, we just need to call this if -h is passed or no arguments are given.\nif [[ $# == 0 ]] || [[ \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;-h\u0026#34; ]]; then sed -rn \u0026#39;s/^### ?//p\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; exit 0 fi Hope it helps!\n","date":"16 February 2022","permalink":"https://leonh.fr/posts/shell-script-help/","section":"","summary":"\u003cp\u003eShell scripts are awesome.
